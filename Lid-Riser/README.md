## Quick and Dirty Qidi X Plus 4 Lid Riser
Putting this here for anyone who is interested.
- Print the three .STEP files and assemble as shown
  - Sides (Riser-Left and Riser-Right) should be printed with the fingers facing straight up
  - No support necessary, but feel free to add some outer brim if you suspect your printer will struggle with the height of the print
