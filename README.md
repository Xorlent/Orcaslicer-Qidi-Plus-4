# OrcaSlicer Qidi X-Plus 4 Profiles
OrcaSlicer printer profiles for the brand new Qidi Plus 4 FDM printer.  Profiles were adapted from the ones provided in the latest version of [QIDIStudio](https://github.com/QIDITECH/QIDIStudio), so should work fine.  These profiles have been tested on Qidi X 4 Plus firmware version 1.4.0 and OrcaSlicer 2.1.1.
